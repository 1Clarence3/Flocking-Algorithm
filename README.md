# Flocking-Algorithm
Written in Python, this model attempts to model and animate and the movement of a flock of birds or fish. The model focuses on 3 behaviors: Separation, Alignment, and Cohesion. Specifically, separation refers to the tendency for a single boid to avoid local boids around it. Alignment steers boids towards the average direction or heading of all the boids on screen. Cohesion steers boids twoards the average position of all the boids on screen by visualizing the screen as a cartesian plane. 
The behavior of a boid is determined by neighboring boids. Thus, a radius and angle of perception is set for each boid.
